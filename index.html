    <h1>Wrapping Text With CSS Box Model</h1>
    <div class="circle"></div>
    <p>Demonstration of the traditional way text is wrapped around an image. The image to the left is a circle
    but, because of the box model, text is wrapped around it with square sides. The text to be wrapped was bound
    by this square because css is based off the box model. If you wanted to wrap text around the image, you were limited
    to this square design. This is not a very pleasing way to wrap around an image this is a circle.</p>

    <h1>CSS Shape-Outside - Circle</h1>
    <div class="circle"></div>
    <p>Using a new CSS property called shape-outside, we can easily wrap text to match the shape of the image. We are no
        longer limited to the box model defining the shape around the image to be wrapped. As you can see the text wraps
        around the circle flowing around it using a shape similar to the image. This can be accomplished by using the new
    CSS property shape-outside.</p>
